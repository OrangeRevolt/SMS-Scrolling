# SMS-Scrolling
An example on how to do smooth 8-way scrolling on the Sega Master System using devkitSMS

## Description
This tutorial was made for those that don't want to use an extra library just for scrolling and generally learning how to do it yourself.
Note that this does not do meta tiles nor collision detection, that is left up to you to implement on your own.

## How to run
- Get and install devkitSMS at [https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS]. Follow the steps on the page to setup.
- Compile the example to a Sega Master System rom, using the bat file in the example. Run it in a command prompt or by just clicking it.
- For your commercial projects, replace the tilemap with your own image converted with BMP2Tile. [https://github.com/maxim-zhao/bmp2tile]

That's all too it. Report any bugs, thanks!
